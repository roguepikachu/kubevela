# Invalid Application CRD missing required fields (workflow and policies)
# This CRD is used to test that our validation HOOK detects when the CRD schema
# is missing fields that our controller expects to exist in the schema properties.
# The fields are intentionally missing from the properties map (not just marked as optional)
# to test the hook's ability to detect incomplete CRD schemas before controller startup.
