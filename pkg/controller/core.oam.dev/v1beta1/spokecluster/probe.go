// probe asks the spoke's own API server whether it is healthy, through the cluster-gateway
// proxy, and measures the round trip. It is deliberately a plain reachability check: the
// gateway Secret register wrote is what makes the spoke addressable, so a successful probe
// also proves the registration is usable end to end, not merely written.
//
// The measured latency is returned for discovery to record as clusterInfo.latencyMillis, so
// the probe is where that number comes from rather than a second round trip.
//
// A 401 already forces a credential refresh: reconcileConnect evicts the cached credential
// on that one status, so the next pass remints rather than reusing a rejected token. Mapping
// a 403 to its own condition reason is still a later refinement; today it is described in the
// probe-failure message (see describeProbeFailure) but shares reasonProbeFailed.
