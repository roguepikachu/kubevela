// data.token or the data["tls.crt"]/data["tls.key"] pair, labelled with the credential
// type. That label is what makes cluster-gateway surface the Secret as a virtual cluster.
//
// Registration is idempotent by get-then-create-or-update: Data and the credential-type
// label are replaced wholesale, so a reminted token converges and a kind change (token to
// cert or back) drops the stale arm instead of leaving both present. Create and Update are
// not transactional, so a concurrent writer can turn the Create into an AlreadyExists
// error; that returns for controller-runtime backoff and the next pass converges, which is
// the same posture as the join path.
//
// Two properties of the gateway Secret shape are worth knowing at the call site:
//
//   - Materialized.ServerName has nowhere to go: the Secret carries no server-name key, and
//     cluster-gateway always derives the TLS ServerName from the endpoint host itself. A
//     kubeconfig tls-server-name that actually differs from the endpoint host is refused
//     (see verifyServerNameCompatible) rather than silently registered and left to fail TLS
//     verification on every connection.
//   - An absent ca.crt means an insecure endpoint to cluster-gateway, not "verify against
//     the system roots". That matches the Materialized contract for an empty CAData.
//
// A proxied spoke also loses data["proxy-url"], which the join path writes from the
// kubeconfig, because Materialized carries no proxy. Accepted for Phase 1.
//
// register refuses to adopt a pre-existing Secret it does not recognize (see
// verifyAdoptable): design.md reasoned that the admission webhook already
// rejects a name collision with an existing gateway Secret, but that webhook is stateless
// by design and does not read Secrets, so no such check exists. Without this guard a
// SpokeCluster could silently take over a manually joined cluster's Secret, redirecting
// its traffic to a different cluster and, under detach, later deleting its credential
// when the SpokeCluster itself is deleted. Confirmed live against a real `vela cluster
